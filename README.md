# Read-and-Watch-Later
The Goal of this Application is to fix my issues with Read and Watch Later Lists. They always get too cluttered and unorganized. It's an overwhelming mix of interesting content and stuff that seemed fun at the time. Sorting through or finding the right time to consume is simply too much. Given that, it's far too easy to choose the option of, for example staying on YouTube until you caught up with the day's new interesting content or to open so many tabs it hurts your PC perfromance and there's still a chance you won't get through in a day. But what if you're simply not in the right mindset for a video about

I have tried various solutions in the past; from the standard lists, to dedicated apps to throwing everything on a big canvas in Milanote. This is my attempt at building a soultion for these, and a few more, problems.

You import either via Browser extention (sharing on IOS) or by directly pasting a link in the opened application. The content item gets added to a backlog. When it's convenient you get to enter a flashcard-like interface that lets you categorize and either schedule, skip or discard. If an item is skipped itll return after some time of your choice; if skipped too often it will be discarded.

If a piece of content remains on the list too long it will be moved to the recycle bin as well.

The list can be viewed in different ways. But perhaps the core view will be the current Day where all the scheduled content will appear and can be reordered. You'll be able to hide categories or even lock them if you do not want to be distracted.

The added side benefit of automatically importing from sources you subscribed to may help you escape from the algorithms. I do not know for sure how I imagine this to look like but I could see this being a seperate backlog.

The rest of the feature list and plans will be uploaded here eventually. This is just a short overview until I've actually built something. 


### Current Stage: Planning

Even though it sounds like I plan on shipping this, currently I only intend to use it for myself. But feel free to take inspiration if, unlikely as it seems, this is a fresh take for you and you don't mind setting this up yourself.

At some point, however, I do wish to ship it as part of a larger Life Organization System. But that's far away.
